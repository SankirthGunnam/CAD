# Phase 2: Component Placement

**Development Period**: Week 3-4  
**Status**: âœ… Completed  
**Commit Ready**: Yes

## Overview

This phase builds on Phase 1 by adding actual component placement functionality. Users can now place different types of components on the scene, move them around, and interact with them through context menus.

## New Features Implemented

### âœ… Component Placement System
- **Click-to-Place**: Click component type button, then click on scene to place
- **Multiple Types**: Support for Chip, Resistor, and Capacitor components
- **Visual Differentiation**: Each component type has distinct colors and styling
- **Auto-Naming**: Components automatically named (Chip1, Resistor2, etc.)
- **Precise Positioning**: Components centered on click position

### âœ… Interactive Component System
- **Movable Components**: Drag components around the scene
- **Selectable Components**: Click to select, visual feedback on selection
- **Context Menus**: Right-click components for properties and delete options
- **Properties Dialog**: View component name, type, position, and size
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove individual components via context menu

### âœ… Mode System
- **Placement Mode**: Active when component type selected (green button highlight)
- **Selection Mode**: Default mode for moving and selecting components
- **Visual Feedback**: Button highlighting shows current active mode
- **Mode Switching**: Easy switching between placement and selection modes

### âœ… Enhanced UI Controls
- **Component Type Buttons**: Add Chip, Add Resistor, Add Capacitor
- **Select Mode Button**: Switch to selection/movement mode
- **Clear Scene**: Remove all components from scene
- **Zoom Fit**: Automatically fit components in view
- **Phase Info**: Detailed development progress and usage instructions

### âœ… Advanced Scene Management
- **Component Tracking**: Scene maintains list of all placed components
- **Real-time Updates**: Status bar shows component count and operations
- **Scene Statistics**: Track total components, current mode, selected type
- **Data Export**: Get/set scene data with all component information

```

## Running the Application

```bash
python test_phase2.py
```

## What's Working

### âœ… Core Functionality
1. **Component Placement**: Click button â†’ click scene â†’ component appears
2. **Component Movement**: Select Mode â†’ drag components around
3. **Component Properties**: Right-click â†’ view detailed properties
4. **Component Deletion**: Right-click â†’ delete individual components
5. **Scene Management**: Clear all, zoom fit, real-time status updates
6. **Mode Switching**: Visual feedback for current interaction mode

### âœ… User Experience
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Natural click-to-place interaction
2. **Visual Feedback**: Button highlighting, status messages, tooltips
3. **Responsive Design**: Smooth component movement and selection
4. **Professional Appearance**: Clean styling with color-coded components
5. **Comprehensive Help**: Phase Info dialog with usage instructions

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Component Placement
```bash
# Run the application
python test_phase2.py

# Test component placement:
1. Click "Add Chip" (button turns green)
2. Click anywhere on the gray scene area
3. Watch chip component appear with "Chip1" label
4. Repeat with "Add Resistor" and "Add Capacitor"
```

### Advanced Interactions
```bash
# Test component management:
1. Place several components of different types
2. Click "Select Mode" to switch to selection
3. Drag components around the scene
4. Right-click any component â†’ select "Properties"
5. Right-click any component â†’ select "Delete"
6. Use "Zoom Fit" to fit all components in view
7. Use "Clear Scene" to remove everything
```

## Component Types

### Chip Components (Blue)
- **Color**: Blue background with dark blue border
- **Size**: 100x60 pixels
- **Use Case**: Processor, controller, or IC components
- **Properties**: Movable, selectable, deletable

### Resistor Components (Brown)
- **Color**: Brown background with dark brown border  
- **Size**: 100x60 pixels
- **Use Case**: Passive resistive elements
- **Properties**: Movable, selectable, deletable

### Capacitor Components (Green)
- **Color**: Green background with dark green border
- **Size**: 100x60 pixels  
- **Use Case**: Passive capacitive elements
- **Properties**: Movable, selectable, deletable

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 3: Data Management** will add:
- ðŸ”„ Save/Load scene data to files
- ðŸ”„ Component properties editor dialog
- ðŸ”„ Undo/Redo functionality for all operations
- ðŸ”„ Export scene to various formats (JSON, XML)
- ðŸ”„ Component library with custom shapes
- ðŸ”„ Connection drawing between components

## Development Notes

### Technical Implementation
- **Custom Components**: QGraphicsRectItem-based components with text labels
- **Scene Management**: Custom ComponentScene handles placement logic
- **Mode System**: State-based interaction with visual feedback
- **Signal Architecture**: Component add/remove events properly propagated
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup when components deleted

### Design Decisions
- **Simple Shapes**: Used rectangles for all components for Phase 2 simplicity
- **Color Coding**: Distinct colors make component types immediately recognizable
- **Auto-naming**: Eliminates need for user to name each component manually
- **Context Menus**: Standard right-click interaction pattern
- **Mode Switching**: Clear distinction between placement and selection operations

### Performance Characteristics
- **Smooth Interaction**: No lag during component placement or movement
- **Scalable**: Tested with 50+ components without performance issues
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper object cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Responsive UI**: Status updates and visual feedback in real-time
