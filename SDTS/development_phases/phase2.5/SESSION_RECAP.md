# Phase 2.5 Development Session Recap
## Date: August 17, 2025

### Session Overview
This session focused on implementing Phase 2.5 - Core Functionality Fixes for the SDTS project. This is an interim phase to address critical usability issues before moving to Phase 3.

### What We Accomplished Today

#### âœ… 1. Phase 2.5 Setup Complete
- **Directory Structure**: Created `development_phases/phase2.5/` directory
- **Code Base**: Copied Phase 2 code as starting point
- **Architecture**: Maintained existing MVC structure with enhancements

#### âœ… 2. Zoom Functionality - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: Cannot zoom in/out with Ctrl+scroll
- **Solution**: Enhanced `CustomGraphicsView` class
- **Features**:
  - Ctrl+Scroll wheel for zoom in/out
  - Zoom range: 0.1x to 10.0x
  - Smooth zoom speed (1.15x per scroll)
  - Real-time zoom level display in status bar
  - Proper zoom limits enforcement
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND WORKING

#### âœ… 3. Global Delete Button - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: No global delete button for selected items
- **Solution**: Added "Delete Selected" button to toolbar
- **Features**:
  - Toolbar button with tooltip
  - Delete key keyboard support (Del key)
  - Multi-component selection deletion
  - Visual feedback and status updates
  - Proper component cleanup
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND WORKING

#### âœ… 4. Component Pins - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: Components lacked visible connection pins
- **Solution**: Enhanced all components with `ComponentPin` objects
- **Implementation**:
  - **ComponentPin Class**: Full pin implementation with hover effects
  - **Pin Types**: input, output, power, gnd, terminal, positive, negative
  - **Color Coding**: Green (input), Red (output), Yellow (power), Gray (ground), Light Gray (terminals)
  - **Pin Configurations**:
    - **Chip**: 12 pins total (4 input left, 4 output right, 2 power top, 2 ground bottom)
    - **Resistor**: 2 terminal pins (left/right)
    - **Capacitor**: 2 polarity pins (left/right)
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND WORKING

#### âœ… 5. Wire Drawing System - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Problem**: No way to connect components with wires
- **Solution**: Complete interactive wire drawing system
- **Features**:
  - **Wire Class**: Full wire implementation with start/end pins
  - **Interactive Drawing**: Click pin â†’ drag â†’ click destination pin
  - **Visual Feedback**: Red temporary wires, black permanent wires
  - **Real-time Updates**: Wire follows mouse cursor during drawing
  - **Connection Validation**: Prevents connecting pin to itself
  - **Wire Storage**: Completed wires tracked in scene.wires[]
  - **Wire Deletion**: Right-click context menu on wires
  - **Status Updates**: Real-time connection status messages
  - **Signal System**: wire_added signal properly connected
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND WORKING

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Enhanced Classes
1. **ComponentPin**: Interactive pins with hover, click, and connection capabilities
2. **Wire**: Complete wire implementation with temporary/permanent states
3. **ComponentWithPins**: Enhanced components with visible pins
4. **ComponentScene**: Enhanced scene with wire drawing logic
5. **CustomGraphicsView**: Zoom functionality with Ctrl+scroll
6. **VisualBCFManager**: Enhanced UI with all fixes integrated

#### Event Handling
- Mouse press/release for wire drawing
- Mouse move for live wire updates
- Pin click handling with event consumption
- Keyboard delete key support
- Zoom wheel events with modifier detection

#### Architecture Decisions
- Pin-to-pin connection system
- Z-order: Pins (10) > Wires (5) > Components (0)
- Signal-based communication for data changes
- Proper event handling hierarchy
- Clean separation of concerns

### Testing Status
- **Manual Testing**: Extensive testing performed
- **Wire Drawing**: Successfully tested pin-to-pin connections
- **Component Placement**: All component types working
- **Zoom**: Ctrl+scroll zoom tested and working
- **Delete**: Both button and key deletion working
- **Test Output**: Confirmed wire connections logged correctly

### Files Modified/Created
1. **Main Implementation**: `development_phases/phase2.5/apps/RBM/BCF/gui/src/visual_bcf/visual_bcf_manager.py`
2. **Test Application**: `development_phases/phase2.5/test_phase25.py`
3. **Documentation**: `development_phases/phase2.5/README.md` (needs final updates)
4. **Session Recap**: `development_phases/phase2.5/SESSION_RECAP.md`

### What Still Needs To Be Done

#### ðŸ”„ Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Update to reflect complete wire drawing functionality
- **Phase Info Dialog**: Update to show wire drawing features
- **Testing Instructions**: Add wire drawing testing steps

#### ðŸ”„ Additional Enhancements (Nice to Have)
- **Wire Deletion via Selection**: Delete wires with Del key when selected
- **Multiple Wire Deletion**: Select and delete multiple wires
- **Wire Highlighting**: Visual feedback when hovering over wires
- **Connection Indicators**: Show connection count on components
- **Wire Labels**: Optional wire naming/labeling system

#### ðŸ”„ Testing and Polish
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all features together
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test unusual connection scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Test with many components and wires
- **User Experience**: Fine-tune interaction feedback

#### ðŸ”„ Final Phase 2.5 Completion
- **Code Review**: Final review of implementation
- **Documentation**: Complete all documentation updates
- **Testing**: Final comprehensive testing
- **Commit Preparation**: Prepare for phase completion

### Next Session Priorities (Tomorrow)
1. **Complete Documentation**: Update README.md with wire drawing features
2. **Final Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all Phase 2.5 features
3. **Polish UI**: Any final UI improvements needed
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Address any remaining edge cases
5. **Phase 2.5 Wrap-up**: Finalize and mark phase as complete

### Technical Notes for Tomorrow
- Wire drawing system is fully functional but may need minor refinements
- All core Phase 2.5 requirements are met and working
- Focus should be on documentation, testing, and final polish
- Ready to move to Phase 3 once Phase 2.5 is fully documented and tested

### Test Commands for Tomorrow
```bash
# Activate environment and test
cd /home/sankirth/Projects/CAD/SDTS
source .venv/bin/activate
python development_phases/phase2.5/test_phase25.py

# Test all features:
# 1. Component placement (all types)
# 2. Zoom with Ctrl+scroll
# 3. Global delete button
# 4. Wire drawing between pins
# 5. Wire deletion via right-click
# 6. Component movement and selection
```

### Development Context
- **Project**: SDTS (Schematic Design Tool Suite) - CAD tool for RF board management
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2.5 (Interim fixes)
- **Architecture**: PySide6-based GUI with MVC pattern
- **Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Data Management
- **Session Status**: Major implementation complete, final polish needed
