# Integrated Bump System for Wire Intersections

## 🎯 Overview

The enhanced wire system now includes a sophisticated **integrated bump system** that creates professional-looking wire intersections. Instead of separate curves drawn on top of wires, bumps are now **part of the wire path itself**, making it clear which wire is "jumping over" the other.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Integrated Bumps (Not Separate Curves)**
- **Before**: Bumps were drawn as separate curves on top of wires
- **After**: Bumps are integrated into the wire path itself
- **Result**: Clean, professional appearance with clear wire routing

### 2. **Semi-Circle Hump Design**
- Bumps look like semi-circles that the intersecting wire passes through
- **Horizontal wires**: Create vertical bumps (going up and over)
- **Vertical wires**: Create horizontal bumps (going left and over)
- **Bump size**: 8 pixels for optimal visibility

### 3. **Angle-Based Bump Logic**
- **Rule**: Wire with **smaller angle relative to horizontal axis** creates the bump
- **Examples**:
  - Horizontal wire (0°) creates bumps when intersecting with diagonal/vertical wires
  - Vertical wire (90°) creates bumps when intersecting with diagonal wires
  - Diagonal wire (45°) creates bumps when intersecting with steeper diagonal wires

### 4. **Automatic Bump Management**
- Old bumps are automatically cleared before recalculating paths
- Bumps are recalculated on every wire path update
- No manual bump cleanup required

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Wire Path Structure
```python
class WirePath:
    def __init__(self, start_point: QPointF, end_point: QPointF):
        self.start_point = start_point
        self.end_point = end_point
        self.segments = []  # Wire segments
        self.intersection_bumps = []  # Bump data: (point, direction)
```

### Bump Integration Process
1. **Path Generation**: Wire path is calculated with perpendicular routing
2. **Collision Detection**: Components are avoided using detour routing
3. **Intersection Detection**: Other wires are checked for crossings
4. **Bump Creation**: Bumps are added based on angle-based logic
5. **Path Rendering**: Final path includes integrated bumps

### Path Rendering Algorithm
```python
def get_path(self) -> QPainterPath:
    path = QPainterPath()
    path.moveTo(self.segments[0][0])
    
    for segment_start, segment_end in self.segments:
        # Check for bumps along this segment
        segment_bumps = self._get_bumps_for_segment(segment_start, segment_end)
        
        if not segment_bumps:
            # No bumps, draw segment normally
            path.lineTo(segment_end)
        else:
            # Draw segment with integrated bumps
            self._draw_segment_with_bumps(path, segment_start, segment_end, segment_bumps)
    
    return path
```

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Horizontal Wire with Bump

        /   \
       /     \
      /       \
     /         \
    ─────────────
```
- Wire goes straight to intersection
- Creates semi-circle bump going UP
- Continues straight after bump

### Vertical Wire with Bump

- Wire goes straight to intersection
- Creates semi-circle bump going LEFT
- Continues straight after bump

### Intersecting Wires

         │
```
- Horizontal wire (0°) creates bump (smaller angle)
- Diagonal wire (45°) passes through normally
- Clear visual indication of wire hierarchy

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Bump Creation
```python
from apps.RBM5.BCF.gui.source.visual_bcf.artifacts.connection import WirePath
from PySide6.QtCore import QPointF

# Create wire path
wire_path = WirePath(QPointF(0, 0), QPointF(100, 100))

# Add bump at intersection
wire_path.add_intersection_bump(QPointF(50, 50), "horizontal")

# Get complete path with integrated bumps
path = wire_path.get_path()
```

### Automatic Bump Detection
```python
# The system automatically detects intersections and creates bumps
enhanced_wire = EnhancedWire(start_pin, end_pin, scene)
enhanced_wire.update_path()  # Automatically handles bumps
```

## 🔍 Debug Features

The system includes comprehensive debug logging:

```python
🔍 Wire collision detection: Found 3 components to avoid
🔍 Checking segment 1: (0.0, 0.0) → (50.0, 0.0)
   ✅ No collision for segment 1
🔍 Wire intersection detection: Found 2 other wires to check
🔍 Found 1 intersections with enhanced wire
🔍 Wire intersection detection complete: Added 1 bumps
```

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Deferred Updates**
- Wires are only fully updated after component drag is complete
- No expensive calculations during dragging

### 2. **Lightweight Updates**
- Simple wires use `update_wire_position_lightweight()`
- Skips collision and intersection checks for basic updates

### 3. **Position Caching**
- Skips recalculations if wire endpoints haven't changed
- Reduces unnecessary path updates

### 4. **Smart Bump Management**
- Bumps are cleared and recalculated only when needed
- No accumulation of old, invalid bumps

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts
- `test_integrated_bumps.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `demo_integrated_bumps.py` - Visual demonstration

## 🔄 Migration from Old System

### Backward Compatibility
- Old `Wire` class still works (inherits from `EnhancedWire`)
- Existing code continues to function
- Gradual migration to new features

### API Changes
- `update_line()` → `update_path()` (recommended)
- `update_wire_position_lightweight()` for performance

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Customizable Bump Styles**: Different bump shapes and sizes
2. **Smart Routing**: AI-powered wire routing optimization
